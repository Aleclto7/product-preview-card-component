## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Actually everything I used in this challenge I already knew, I am using these exercises to practice and master these skills. Although as I avance in the difficulty of the challengues i will begin to learn new ones

### Continued development

One of the things that I think would be very useful and would make me improve a lot is to learn a css framework and technologies like React.
